# ASP NET Core Security Basics


The middleware follow the chain-of-responsabilities pattern, to deal with all things in the pipeline 
â€” authenticatio, authorization, other handlers.

The main concept in ASP NET is the **ClaimsPrincipal** representing the security context, that can have one or more
identities (having a default one). If not logged, identity is anonymous.
